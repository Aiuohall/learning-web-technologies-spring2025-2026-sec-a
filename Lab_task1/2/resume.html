    <p>
        I am a Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate with a strong foundation
        in programming, object-oriented concepts, and problem-solving. I have completed
        multiple academic projects using C# and Java, including projects based on OOP
        and OOP2 principles, and have hands-on experience with C++, Python, Java, and HTML.
        I also have a growing interest in IoT-based systems and emerging technologies.
        I am seeking opportunities to develop my skills further and build a career as a
        dedicated and competent software engineer.
